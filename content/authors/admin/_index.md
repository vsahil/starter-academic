Hello! I am a PhD student in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am interested in exploring ways to make Machine Learning trustworthy. I have explored explainability and fairness aspects of Machine Learning to make it trustworthy. I hope to continue exploring this area in future.

I majored in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in) and graduated with a minor in Computer Science in 2019. At IIT Kanpur, I worked on research projects in Fairness in Machine Learning and Program Analysis of Machine Learning and C code.
In my free time, I enjoy reading blogs, connecting with old friends, and pop music.
